Network Protocols
Rules and procedures for transmitting data across a network.

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model - separates network communitation into 7 layers of abstraction:
1: Physical Layer - electronic cicuit transmission (bits, not data packets)
USB, Bluetooth
2: Data Link Layer - transferring data between network nodes
Ethernet
3: Network Layer - packets get forwarded here otherwise known as routing
IPv4, IPv6
4: Transport Layer - 
TCP
5: Session Layer
6: Presentation Layer
7: Application Layer

Most common:
TCP/IP
ARP
DHCP
DNS
(S/T)FTP
HTTP(S)


TCP
IP

ARP

DHCP

DNS

FTP
SFTP
TFTP

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, 80)
HTTPS (Hypetext Transfer Protocol Secure, 443)


BONUS PROTOCOL
telnet (Teletype Network, 23)
Establishes remote terminal connection for bidirectional text based communication.
This allows the user of one computer to log into another computer on the same network.
telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
(some versions of mac dont have telnet on them anymore so `brew install telnet`)
bonnus fact: SSH (secure socket shell, 22) is basically just secure telnet

BONUS PROTOCOL AGAIN
H.323 port 1720/1721 for video conferences
SIP port 5060/5061 for computer-telephone (audio conferences)
